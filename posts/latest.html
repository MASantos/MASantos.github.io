<p>I want to quickly write down a reminder than often gets forgotten. At least, it happened now while I was trying to get<br />
the right priors for a bayesian analysis of two groups in <strong>R</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="intro"><a href="#overview">Intro</a></h2>
<p>I have a cron job that, when connected to my mobile internet provider, every 2 hours sends 100 ping packets to Google's DNS servers at 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4. Once I get enough data, I want to check the quality of service of my internet connection (find &quot;dark&quot; time frames, routing differences, regular congestions,...).</p>
<p>For the bayesian statistical analysis I'm testing the scripts <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~kruschke/BEST/">BEST</a> by <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~kruschke/">John K. Kruschke</a>. I'm using <a href="http://rstudio.com/"><strong>RStudio</strong></a> for Ubuntu 14.04 in a virtual machine on my Snow Leopard (yikes!) laptop.</p>
<p>Long story short, not being convinced I was using the right priors, I decided I should check I had all notation and values under control. Was I using all R functions correctly? Are these t-student prior distributions really the ones I think I'm using? Am I describing those outliers properly with the parameter values I'm choosing?</p>
<p>I decided to compare the t-student R-functions (dt(...), rt(...)) to those for a gaussian. As stated in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution">Wikipedia</a>, a t-student probability density has a longer tail than a (<em>corresponding</em>) gaussian distribution. Here, <em>corresponding</em> means same mean and variance. These two values uniquely specify a gaussian distribution as the latter is characterized by having all cummulants higher than 2nd order identically zero. How this may lead to a larger tail for a t-student is something I'll leave for a subsequent update of this post.</p>
<h2 id="comparing-variances"><a href="#overview">Comparing variances</a></h2>
<p>Which of the following probability distributions have a larger <em>variability</em>? Try to come up with a quick, but reasonable answer<br />
before reading further.</p>
<p><img src="../images/tstudentVSgaussian/tvsg-df3-df-nolab.jpeg" alt="Which probability density function shows a larger variability?" /></p>
<p>If I now tell you that the one in red corresponds to a gaussian and that in black to a t-student, does it make it easier? The gaussian clearly seems to have a broader range of higher probability values than the t-student (more or less for all value within $1.5&lt;|x|&lt;4$). So, would you say the gaussian shows a higher <em>variability</em>.</p>
<p>Our intuitions about what <em>variability</em> means might well be misguided. I was convinced this gaussian would show a higher <em>dispersion</em> (another fancy metaphor still too ambiguous) of values. But enough with misleading terms. We all know how to <strong>measure</strong> the variability (or dispersion, or...) of a random variable.</p>
<p>Here the R-code for that plot</p>
<pre><code>#degrees of freedom &amp; standard deviation
df=3 ; s = sqrt(df/(df-2))
#domain range to plot
low=3*2*(m-max(m,1)) ; high=3*max(2*m,2)
#t-student dist. 
plot(function(x) dt(x,df),low,high,ylab=&quot;&quot;,xlab=&quot;&quot;) ; 
#gaussian dist.
curve(dnorm(x,m,s),from=low,to=high,n=101,col=&quot;red&quot;, add = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>Let me give you another hint, both distribution in that plot have the same variance! The variance of a t-student with $df&gt;2$ degrees of freedom is $v=df/(df-2)$. The standard deviation of the gaussian plotted exactly corresponds to such a variance.</p>
<p><img src="../images/tstudentVSgaussian/tvsg-df3-df.jpeg" alt="Which probability density function shows a larger variability?" /></p>
<p>Well, that clarifies one point. Yet, the guassian clearly has a broader &quot;head&quot; within the interval we mentioned. Is this already then the <em>tail</em> region? That is, sampling at random values from both distributions as plotted, would the gaussian sample show every now and then larger (and or more frequent) outliers than the corresponding t-student?</p>
<p>Well, according to all references, this shouldn't be the case. But let's do the sampling and judge then.</p>
<p><img src="../images/tstudentVSgaussian/tvsg-df3-sample1k.jpeg" alt="N=1000 points sampling for t-student with $df=3$ and its corresponding guassian distribution" /></p>
<p>Now we can clearly see that both distribution show a comparable variance (in fact identical -ignoring for now imprecisions in the algorithms R is using for sampling both): the main glob of point in both samples is limited to basically the same range.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is also clear that the t-student shows larger outliers than the gaussian. This is a stochastic process, so repeating the sampling will show some variability, but one can easily convince oneself that indeed things work as supposed, despite the misleading look of both probability densities.</p>
<p>Here some more samples. Sometimes the outliers do not seem that much larger...</p>
<p><img src="../images/tstudentVSgaussian/tvsg-df3-sample1k-3.jpeg" alt="Sometimes the outliers do not seem that much larger..." /><br />
but this a random process, and for such low df values...<br />
<img src="../images/tstudentVSgaussian/tvsg-df3-sample1k-2.jpeg" alt="but this a random process, and for such low df values..." /><br />
we can often find huge surprises:<br />
<img src="../images/tstudentVSgaussian/tvsg-df3-sample1k-4.jpeg" alt="Three different samplings of N=1000 points for a t-student with $df=3$ and its corresponding guassian distribution" /><br />
This last sample shows a huge outlier of more than 20 times larger that the standard deviation! To get some perspective of how huge such outlier is<br />
the probability to get such a large deviation for a gaussian distribution is less 10^-116 !!</p>
<p>(In R, you may issue <code>pnorm(-23)*2</code> to get the probability of such an (gaussian) outlier at either end.)</p>
<h2 id="limit-of-large-variance"><a href="#overview">Limit of large variance</a></h2>
<p>This is the case of $$df\to\infty$$ where the t-student tends to a gaussian of variance $$df/(df-2)$$.</p>
<p>For df=100 a simple plot of both distribution seems to show already a convergence.<br />
<img src="../images/tstudentVSgaussian/tvsg-df100-df.jpeg" alt="t-student and corresponding gaussian for df=100" /></p>
<p>However, this is (again) highly misleading, as a sampling may show:<br />
<img src="../images/tstudentVSgaussian/tvsg-df100-sample1k.jpeg" alt="N=1000 points samples of t-student and corresponding gaussian for df=100" /><br />
A closer look at the tails shows:<br />
<img src="../images/tstudentVSgaussian/tvsg-df100-df-tails.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Compare this to the cases of df=10 and df=1000:<br />
<img src="../images/tstudentVSgaussian/tvsg-df10-df-tails.jpeg" alt="" /><br />
<img src="../images/tstudentVSgaussian/tvsg-df1k-df-tails.jpeg" alt="Asymptotic behavior of t-student and corresponding gaussian for df=10,100,1000" /><br />
Thus, for an apparently already large value of df=100, the algorithms in R show a clear distinct asymptotic behaviour of both distributions.</p>
<p>This is how some samplings look like (whatch for those systematic large outliers of the t-student as compared to the gaussian):<br />

<img src="../images/tstudentVSgaussian/tvsg-df1k-sample10k-stilloutliers-2.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
<p>For df=100 the probability of having an outlier larger than 4 times the standard deviation is 2 times higher for the t-student as compared to the gaussian case. In R, issue <code>pt(-4,df=100)/pnorm(-4)</code>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions"><a href="#overview">Conclusions</a></h2>
<p>The tail of a prob. density function $f(x)$ controls the frequency of very large outliers. Mathematically it is determined by the limit behavior (e.g., for the right tail) $\lim_{x\to\infty}f(x)$. A closer look at those density plots shows that for $|x|&gt;5$ the probability for outliers is higher for the t-student case than for the coresponding gaussian distribution. A log scale for the y-axis helps in visualizing this.</p>
<p><img src="../images/tstudentVSgaussian/tvsg-df3-df-tails.jpeg" alt="Tails for t-student (df=3) and corresponding gaussian distributions" /></p>
<p>In summary, the difference in both density plots can roughly be explained as follows: For the guassian distribution the values <em>constantly</em> fluctuate bettween say x=-4 and 4, but <em>not beyond that range</em>. However, for a t-student distribution, the values mostly stay within a narrower band, but, in comparison, there are <em>very frequently, large fluctuations</em> way beyond that range. This compensates that narrower &quot;head&quot; we see to give the same variance for both distributions.</p>

<p>You can use the R-script below to check the plots for different values of the variance. This last plot can be obtained by issuing</p>
