First tests with Hadoop 2.6.5 on my MacBook Pro OSX 10.6.8

## Overview

Recording what happened while getting a hadoop version running and testing the first java, python and 
bash scripts as hadoop standalone and streaming runs.

### Hadoop install & config


### Examples

## data

HCN: NOOA's US historical climate network data. 

## Reference: The plain bash script (no hadoop)

This will be the reference to compare to simply because it's the **fastest**. Hadoop as standalone
can't beat this.

## Hadoop standalone: Java Mapper and Reducer

## Hadoop Streaming I : Python Mapper & Reducer

## Hadoop Streaming II : Python single script & /usr/bin/cat as trivial reducer

###  Conclusions

### Why Should I Care?
